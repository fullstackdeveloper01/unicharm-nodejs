## ✅ Verification

### Files Checked:
- ✅ No remaining `categoryController.js` files
- ✅ No remaining `categoryRoutes.js` files
- ✅ No remaining `categoryService.js` files
- ✅ No Category model file (`models/Category.js` was already deleted by user)
- ✅ No Category model associations in other models
- ✅ Route registration removed from `routes/index.js`

### Important Notes:

1. **Employee Category Field**: The `Category` field in Employee, Department, Designation, Accountant, and Auditor models is **NOT related** to the Category module. These are simple string fields for categorization (e.g., "Regular", "Contract", "Temporary").

2. **User Categories Dropdown**: The route `/api/employees/dropdowns/user-categories` is **NOT related** to the Category module. It returns hardcoded employee category values:
   - Regular
   - Contract
   - Temporary

3. **Postman Collections**: The Postman collections still contain Category endpoints, but these will return 404 errors since the routes no longer exist. These can be manually removed from Postman if needed.

---

## 🎯 Summary

**Total Files Deleted**: 3
- 1 Controller
- 1 Route
- 1 Service

**Total Files Modified**: 1
- routes/index.js (removed route registration)

**No Breaking Changes**: The removal of the Category module does not affect:
- Employee management
- Department management
- Designation management
- Any other existing functionality

---

## 📌 Next Steps (Optional)

If you want to clean up the Postman collections:

1. **SuperAdmin Collection**: Remove the "Categories" folder
2. **Complete Collection**: Remove the "Categories" folder from SuperAdmin section

These are optional as the endpoints will simply return 404 if called.

**Status**: ✅ Category module successfully removed from codebase!
